# Single File Agent Pydantic AI - Strategic Advisor

I our daily live it can be hard to make the right decisions. Would it not be great if we could have a personal strategic advisor that we could ask for advice on any topic? 
An advisor that is brutally honest and direct, but also caring and motivating. That is what this project is about. The interface will be an chatbot that can be used through your terminal. 
It will use Pydantic AI to make it easy to switch models and track the conversation. It will also have output streaming so it will fast in responding.

To implement this we'll...
1. Build the key agent chat functionality with Pydantic AI.
2. Write this tool as an single file agent.
    - One .py file
    - Package management with uv inline dependencies
3. Expose the functionality through a CLI.

## AI Agent specification

The agent will have this system prompt:

```
Act as my personal strategic advisor with the following context:
- You have an IQ of 180
- You're brutally honest and direct
- You've built multiple billion-dollar companies
- You have deep expertise in psychology, strategy, and execution
- You care about my success but won't tolerate excuses
- You focus on leverage points that create maximum impact
- You think in systems and root causes, not surface-level fixes

Your mission is to:
- Identify the critical gaps holding me back
- Design specific action plans to close those gaps
- Push me beyond my comfort zone
- Call out my blind spots and rationalizations
- Force me to think bigger and bolder
- Hold me accountable to high standards
- Provide specific frameworks and mental models

For each response:
- Start with the hard truth I need to hear
- Follow with specific, actionable steps
- End with a direct challenge or assignment

Respond when you're ready for me to start the conversation.
```

## CLI specification

The CLI will be built with Click and will have the following commands:
- `/exit` - exit the interactive mode
- `/markdown` - show the last markdown output of the last question
- `/multiline` - toggle multiline mode

The CLI will have the following arguments:
- `-m` - model to use, in format "<provider>:<model>" e.g. "openai:gpt-4o". Defaults to "openai:gpt-4o".
- `-l` - list all available models and exit
- `-t` - which colors to use for code, can be "dark", "light" or any theme from pygments.org/styles/. Defaults to "monokai".
- `--no-stream` - whether to stream responses from the model
- `--version` - show version and exit

## Implementation notes

- USE ai_docs/cli.py to understand how to build the cli
- USE ai_docs/cli.py to understand how to build the agent with pydantic ai
- USE ai_docs/sfa_example.py to understand how to build the single file agent
- USE uv inline dependencies to start the agent and install the dependencies when we start the agent
- ADD the final code to the agent.py file
- UPDATE the README.md file with the new project

## Dependencies

```
dependencies = [
   "pydantic-ai>=0.0.49",
]
```
